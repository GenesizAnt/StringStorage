# StringStorage
PET project - Write a string store with CRUD logic. The program must be able to save, edit, update and delete strings sent to it. Each string to be saved must be assigned some id (numeric). Interaction with the program must be done via the console.

Example API for saving: Input: CREATE {some_string} Output: String saved with id = {id}

Example API for reading all strings: Input: GET Output: Array of all saved strings

Example API for reading a specific string: Input: GET 4 Output: The string whose id = 4 is output

Example API for editing of a specific string: Input: UPDATE 4 {new_string_value} Output: String with id = 4 updated

Example API to delete string Input: DELETE 3 Output: String with id = 3 deleted
